        or platform, we may use your IP address to infer an approximation of
        your location when using certain features of the Flexemarket Services,

        <br />
        14. Information for California Residents.
        <br />
        This section provides additional disclosures required by the California
        Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), which applies to the personal information
        we collect about California residents. In the preceding 12 months, we
        have collected the following categories of personal information:
        identifiers (such as name, contact information, device identifiers and
        state-issued ID numbers); internet or other electronic network activity
        information (such as usage data); demographic information (such as age);
        commercial information (such as products purchased or sold); geolocation
        data; inferences (such as approximate location); visual or similar
        information (such as photographs of yourself); and other information
        that relates to or is reasonably capable of being associated with you
        and that does not fit neatly into one of the other categories (such as
        personal information contained in reviews, comments and communications
        with us). For more details about the personal information we collect,
        including the categories of sources, please see the Collection of
        Information section above. We collect personal information for the
        business and commercial purposes listed in the Use of Information
        section above. We share the personal information we collect with the
        categories of third parties listed in the Sharing of Information section
        above. Subject to certain limitations, the CCPA provides California
        residents with the right to: request to know about the personal
        information that we have collected about you in the 12 months preceding
        your request (including the categories of information collected, the
        source of that information, the business purpose of that collection, the
        categories of third parties with whom that information is shared, and
        the specific pieces of personal information collected about you);request
        to delete any personal information about you that we have
        collected;opt-out of "sales" of personal information to third parties,
        if applicable; andnot to be discriminated against for exercising these
        rights. CCPA requires that we provide transparency about personal
        information we "sell", which is broadly defined. While we don’t share
        personal information in exchange for money, we do allow Google’s online
        advertising service to collect identifiers (such as cookies and other
        device identifiers) and internet or other electronic network information
        (such as the webpage you visited) through the Flexemarket Service for
        the purpose of sending personalized ads to you. This activity may be
        considered a "sale" under California law. To opt out of this "sale",
        please visit our Do Not Sell My Personal Information page. We do not
        knowingly sell personal information about consumers under the age of 16.
        To submit a request to know or a request to delete, please send an email
        to ccpa@Flexemarket.com. In both cases, we will verify your request by
        asking you to provide information that matches information we have on
        file about you. You may designate another person as your authorized
        agent to act on your behalf with regard to CCPA requests. If you have
        designated an authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf, we
        will require proof that the person is authorized to act on your behalf
        and may also still ask you to verify your identity with us directly.
